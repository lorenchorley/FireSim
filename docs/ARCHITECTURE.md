# FireSim architecture

FireSim is an on-site **education** tool for beginner bush firefighters working in the mountains of NSW.
It builds a 3‑D model of the user's surroundings, pulls weather for now / a past date / the forecast (or a preset, a
historic fire day, belt-kit readings), lets the user mark where fire is, and runs a **coupled 3‑D atmosphere + fire
spread + ember** simulation in a Web Worker. It then explains *why* the fire behaves as it does.

> FireSim is a training aid. It is not an operational prediction tool. Always follow the directions of the
> Incident Controller and NSW RFS procedures.

The normative model specification is [`research/00-synthesis.md`](research/00-synthesis.md) (the "spec"; § numbers
below refer to it). Its §2 contract changes are implemented in `src/core/`; where the code deviates, the deviation is
recorded in the module's top-of-file notes and summarised below.

## Stack

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| App shell | **Capacitor 8** (Android + iOS) around a Vite 8 + TypeScript 5.9 web app | One codebase; WebGL2 and module Web Workers in the system WebView; native HTTP (CapacitorHttp) bypasses CORS on government data services; testable in Chromium with Playwright |
| 3‑D | **Three.js** (WebGL2), on-demand rendering | Instancing for tens of thousands of trees, runs in mobile WebViews |
| Compute | one **Web Worker** running plain TypeScript kernels on typed arrays | Keeps the UI responsive; deterministic; unit-tested in Node (Vitest) |
| Data | Open‑Meteo (BOM ACCESS‑G, ECMWF, GFS, ERA5); NSW Spatial Services LiDAR DTM + imagery (demo sites); AWS Terrain Tiles (SRTM); Meta/WRI canopy height; NSW NPWS fire history; NSW SVTM vegetation; NSW RFS feeds | Free, no API keys, Australian coverage |
| Offline | Bundled demo sites (`public/demo/`) and historic weather (`public/replays/`), user-downloaded **area packs** and a response cache in IndexedDB | Mountain fire grounds often have no mobile coverage |

```

`ui/modules.ts` resolves the implementations: `buildScenario` (src/scenario), `SimClient` (src/sim, Web Worker) and
`SceneView` (src/render) are loaded lazily with `import.meta.glob` (separate chunks). `?mock=1` uses the mocks
(`ui/mockScenario.ts`, `ui/mockSim.ts`, `ui/mockScene.ts` — a 2-D map); a module that fails to load, or a
`SceneView` that throws (no WebGL2), falls back to its mock with a warning and a visible "Demo engine" / "2-D map"
banner.

### Coupling loop inside the worker (one atmosphere step Δt_a, spec §12.2, `src/sim/simulation.ts`)

1. Due records (ignitions, fuel/wind edits, removals, options, quality) in (time, insertion) order; ember spot
   ignitions scheduled by the previous step.
2. Weather stamp pair → `atm.setAmbient`; `weatherAt(t)`; stable-night state → `atm.setNightState`.
3. Every 600 s: insolation → `atm.setSurfaceHeating`, `moisture.update`, `fire.refreshMoistureCache`.
4. Every 60 s or on a 22.5° wind-sector change: `fire.refreshMasks`; `atm.surfaceWindForFire` (background, fire
   wind, ridge, slope flows, lee blend); `atm.airAt`.
5–6. `fire.prepare(env)`; `fire.step(Δt_a, env)` (CFL sub-steps).
7. coupling > 0: `atm.addFireHeat` (previous step's heat); `atm.step(Δt_a)`.
8. `embers.emit` + `embers.step(atm.sample, atm.sampleTurb, landing, onIgnite)`.
9. Every 60 s: `fire.minuteTasks`; `atm.diagnostics`; `explain.update(view)`.
10. `t += Δt_a`; snapshots every `snapshotInterval` (300 s), checkpoints every 1800 s (ring of 8 + t0).

Δt_a = min(atm.maxStableDt(), 12 s) (fast tier 10 s), clipped so t lands on every minute.

## Module contracts

The shared types are in `src/core/types.ts` and `src/core/simTypes.ts` (spec §2.1–2.2). The module signatures of
spec §2.4 are normative; the real entry points, with the deviations the builders recorded:

```ts
// data/ (index.ts)
loadElevation(req): Promise<ElevationResult>;  loadCanopy(grid, opts): Promise<CanopyResult | null>;
loadDemoDem(siteId); loadDemoImageryInfo(siteId) → { url, meta };  imageryWindow(meta, grid) → pixel window;
openCache(): KV;  saveAreaPack / listAreaPacks / findAreaPacks / loadAreaPackItem / deleteAreaPack;
resolveAssetBase()  // directory of the document, or the app root from inside the worker (…/assets/…)
// terrain/
buildTerrain(grid, elevation, source, opts?): Terrain;  terrainDerived(terrain): TerrainDerived (cached);
solarPosition(timeMs, lat, lon);  insolation(terrain, timeMs, opts): InsolationResult;  castShadows, skyViewFactor, hillshade
// fuel/  (spec §2.4, plus fuelParamsInto(fuel, k, out) for allocation-free kernels)
buildFuelMap(args): FuelMap;  applyFuelEdit(fuel, edit, base, history, t0): number;  cellsInBrush(grid, shape)
// fuel/moisture
new MoistureModel(terrain, fuel, derived, opts?, resolve?)  // initialise / update / breakdown / checkpoint
// fire/
computeTerrainFeatures(terrain, derived, hiRes?);  new FireSpreadModel(terrain, fuel, features, opts, rng, params?)
// atmosphere/ (tier factory instead of two public constructors)
createAtmosphere(terrain, hiRes, fuel, features, tier, extent, series, rng, …): Atmosphere | DiagnosticWind
//   + setWindEdits(edits, startMs), setCoupling(c), setNightState(night), surfaceWindForFire(…), airAt(…)
// embers/
new EmberModel(terrain, fuel, { maxEmbers, tier, … }, rng)   // emit / step / particles / stats / overlays
// explain/
new InsightEngine(terrain, derived, fuel, features, …)       // update / explainAt / forecastInsights / layers
// scenario/ (entry point spec §2.3)
buildScenario(req: ScenarioRequest, onProgress, signal?): Promise<ScenarioData>;
WEATHER_PRESETS[id].build(start, hours, site) / canonicalStart(lon, year);  REPLAYS;  downloadAreaPack(req, onProgress, signal)
```

### sim/

Normative: spec §12 (coupling order §12.2, stats §12.3, checkpoints §12.4, determinism §12.5, tiers §12.6) and the
protocol in `src/sim/protocol.ts` (§2.3, with two additions below).
```ts
// simulation.ts — synchronous orchestrator (worker or Node)
export class Simulation {
  constructor(scenario: ScenarioData, opts?: { tier?: 'auto' | QualityTier; hooks?: { snapshot?(s: SimSnapshot): void;
    rewound?(time: number): void }; clock?: () => number; skipSpinUp?: boolean;
    testHooks?: { moisture?(M, FA, t): void; surfaceHeating?: boolean; emberLanding?(ev): void } });  // §15 set-ups only
  readonly forecastInsights: Insight[];                   // 'ready' payload (§10.3)
  spinUp(deadlineMs?: number): boolean;                    // 3-D spin-up 900 s + auto-tune; t0 checkpoint when done
  advance(until: number, deadlineMs?: number, shouldStop?: () => boolean): boolean;   // whole Δt_a steps
  ignite(i: Ignition): void; edit(e: ScenarioEdit, time: number): void; removeEdit(id: string): void;   // timed records
  removeIgnition(id: string): boolean;                     // undo a mark: delete its record, rewind to it, re-run
  setOption(key: SimOptionKey, value: number | boolean): void; setQuality(tier: QualityTier): void;
  rewind(time: number): number;                            // restores the latest checkpoint ≤ time; returns its time
  explain(x: number, y: number, time?: number): CellExplanation;
  snapshot(): SimSnapshot; stats(): SimStats; perf(): SimPerf;
  readonly time: number; readonly tier: QualityTier; readonly isReady: boolean; readonly logicalNow: number;
}
// host.ts — chunked message loop (≤ 40 ms chunks, yields between them) shared by the worker and LocalSimController
export class SimHost { constructor(port: { post(msg: FromWorker, transfer?: Transferable[]): void }, opts?); handle(msg: ToWorker): void; }
// worker.ts — Web Worker entry (MessageChannel yield, transferable snapshot buffers)
// client.ts
export class SimClient implements SimController { constructor(worker?: Worker); }   // in-thread fallback without Worker
export class LocalSimController implements SimController { }                        // same host in the calling thread
```
Every user action (ignition, fuel/wind edit, edit removal, option, quality tier) is a *record* with a simulation time,
applied at the start of the first atmosphere step at or after that time in (time, insertion) order; a record in the
past rewinds to it (posting `rewound`). `rewind(t)` restores the latest checkpoint ≤ t (ring of 8 every 1800 s + the
permanent t0 one), re-runs silently to t and then streams again, so a re-run is bitwise identical.

Protocol additions of the integration (both backwards compatible):
* `explain` carries an optional view `time` (`SimController.explain(x, y, time?)`); arrival state is evaluated at
  min(time, now) — "Why here?" answers for the moment on screen, also when scrubbed back.
* `removeIgnition(id)` (ToWorker `{ type: 'removeIgnition', id }`): removes a marked ignition as if it had never been
  marked. The record is deleted; if it had burnt, the latest checkpoint ≤ its time is restored and the run repeated to
  the user's logical time; `rewound(ignitionTime)` is posted and every snapshot / insight after that time is emitted
  again. The UI session drops its results after that time at once.

Coupling choices that deviate from the spec text (validation of §15, `src/sim/validation/`; parameters in
`SIM_PARAMS` / `ATMOS_PARAMS`):
* Fast-tier pyrogenic correction (§8.8, D32): the sim passes the fire's prepared cells and their outward front normals
  as the head mask (`FireSpreadModel.headCells`, `pyroCorrectionMinDirection` 0), and u_p keeps only its component
  along the normal there (`pyroHeadAlongOnly`). The empirical rates already contain the fire's own indraft; the
  spec's head-only, wind-direction rule slowed calm/anabatic upslope runs by up to 25 % and sped up backing.
* 3-D tiers: by day the buoyancy excludes the band mean of the surface warming (`buoyancyBandAnomaly`; flat terrain
  kept 2.5× the forecast U10 without it); embers loft kinematically to the Briggs height in every tier
  (`SIM_PARAMS.emberLoft` 'briggs'; the 200 m sub-grid plume gave 0.2–0.4 × Mk5 spotting distances).

`src/sim/validation/*.test.ts` run the §15 scenarios (V1–V22) headless on synthetic terrain and the demo sites; the
long ones run with `SLOW=1`. Criteria the model does not meet yet are `it.fails` tests with the measured values.

### explain/

`explainCell` (spec §10.4) ranks the §6.12 factor decomposition. The fire model's wind and slope factors are those
of the **head fire** (`FireSpreadModel.factorsFor`: slope = hybrid head rate / wind-only head rate), so for a cell on
a flank or at the back the ellipse factor `SpreadFactors.direction` (R(ψ)/R_H) takes part in the ranking and is worded
as the cell's position ("the back of the fire, about 3 % of the head-fire speed"); the slope line then describes the
head fire's slope and names the edge's own slope separately.

### render/

```ts
export interface SceneViewApi {                       // src/render/api.ts — also implemented by ui/mockScene.ts
  setScenario(terrain, fuel, opts?: { imagery?: SceneImagery | null; hiRes?: { grid; elevation } | null }): void;
  setStartTime?(unixMs): void;                         // sun / shadows follow the scenario clock from the first frame
  refreshFuel(fuel): void;  update(snapshot: SimSnapshot): void;  setLayers(l: Partial<LayerState>): void;
  setIgnitions(ignitions, spots): void;  setInsights(insights): void;  focusInsight(insight | null, fly?): void;
  pickGround(clientX, clientY): [x, y] | null;  projectToScreen(x, y): [cx, cy] | null;  flyTo(x, y, distance?): void;
  setViewMode('orbit' | 'top' | 'ground'): void;  setUserLocation(x, y, headingDeg?): void;
  setViewInsets({ top, right, bottom, left }): void;   // covered screen areas: fly-to targets land in the rest
  zoomBy(factor): void;  readonly heading: number;  setHeading(deg): void;   // zoom / compass buttons
  viewSection?(animate?): void;                        // side-on view of the cross-section (3-D view only)
  setBrushPreview(p | null): void;  setInteractionEnabled(on): void;  stats(); resize(); dispose();
}
```
* The terrain mesh is built from `ScenarioData.terrainHiRes` (the 10 m DEM) when present, decimated to the quality
  budget (224 / 320 / 400 samples per side), so cliffs are finer than the 30 m fire grid; fuel, fire and overlays are
  draped from the fire grid.
* View insets use `camera.setViewOffset` with a widened field of view: the canvas keeps its angular size and the
  optical centre moves to the middle of the unobscured area (animated). The UI centres its crosshair there.
* Aerial imagery: `src/data` locates it and computes the window (`loadDemoImageryInfo`, `imageryWindow`); the UI
  (`ui/imagery.ts`) crops it for the domain from the named demo site or any demo site that covers it.
* Snapshot overlays: `SimSnapshot.layers` ('vls', 'attach', 'trench', 'dmz', 'landing') on the fire grid.
* Wind particles use a cool palette (grey-blue → white → cyan → blue → violet) so they never read as fire.
* Legends: `legendFor(overlay)`, `crossSectionLegend()`, `windLegend(mode)`; the UI shows them in the Layers panel
  and as a compact legend on the map.

### ui/

* `ui/session.ts` (`SimSession`) owns the time model: view time vs the newest computed time, a bounded look-ahead
  (`runTarget`), playback, scrubbing through `SnapshotStore`, edits at the view time (rewinding the worker when the
  view is in the past), `removeIgnition`, what-if re-runs with a baseline, insight reveal as the clock passes them.
* Insight flood control (`ui/insightGroups.ts`): a large fire reports the same phenomenon along its whole edge
  (hundreds of cards in 6 h). The Insights tab and the map show one card / marker per kind (the newest of the most
  severe instances, "seen N times since …"); `DangerGate` toasts a kind at most once per simulated hour and "pause on
  danger" pauses only the first time a kind is dangerous.
* Setup catalogues come from `src/scenario` (`WEATHER_PRESETS` / `PRESET_IDS`, `REPLAYS`); a preset starts on its
  canonical day and hour (e.g. 20 Dec 11:00 LMST), rounded to 10 min. Belt-kit readings are sent as
  `ScenarioRequest.beltKit` so the builder applies the psychrometer at the real station pressure and the 2 m → 10 m
  wind conversion.
* Performance mode changes during a run call `SimController.setQuality` ('battery' → fast, 'auto' → standard,
  'quality' → high). A fast-tier run offers "Use the 3-D atmosphere" in the Layers panel where it matters.

## Build and deployment

* `vite.config.ts`: `base: './'` (relative URLs everywhere, so the build runs from any path and inside Capacitor),
  `worker.format: 'es'` (the simulation worker is its own ES-module chunk), code-split sim / render / scenario chunks,
  source maps except in `--mode capacitor` (`npm run build:cap`).
* `public/demo` and `public/replays` are copied to `dist/` and read at run time through `data/assets.ts`
  (`resolveAssetBase` works from the page and from the worker).
* `capacitor.config.ts`: `webDir: 'dist'`, https scheme on Android, CapacitorHttp for CORS-free requests. Steps to
  create and run the native projects are in the README.

## Performance

Measured in headless Chromium, one 2.1 GHz Xeon core, Katoomba 6 km at 30 m, extreme preset, 4 simulated hours:
fast tier ≈ 900 simulated s per wall s, standard (3-D 45 × 45 × 20) ≈ 220 s/s; the first snapshot 1.1–1.2 s after
`init`; the 3-D spin-up (≈ 3 s) runs while the user marks the fire. Snapshots are 1.8 MB (fast) / 2.6 MB (standard)
and transferred, not copied. On the main thread no long task (> 50 ms) was observed while playing at maximum speed;
`SceneView.update` takes ≈ 4 ms median, 9 ms p95. Phones are 2–3× slower (spec §13); the spec's auto-tune (§12.6)
therefore usually picks the fast tier on phones. Spec budgets and CI gates: §13 (V20).

## Testing

* `npm test` — Vitest unit tests of every module against published values and physical sanity checks, the §15
  validation scenarios (`src/sim/validation/`, long ones with `SLOW=1`) and the 3-h Katoomba run
  (`src/sim/validation.test.ts`, skip with `FIRESIM_SKIP_SLOW=1`).
* `npx playwright test` — Pixel 7 profile, Chromium with SwiftShader WebGL, against the production build:
  `e2e/app.spec.ts` (the whole app with the real modules end to end, screenshots into `docs/screenshots/`),
  `e2e/sim.spec.ts` (the real worker), `e2e/ui.spec.ts` (the UI on the mocks).
